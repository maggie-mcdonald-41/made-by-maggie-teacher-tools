Welcome to The Debate. Today we're asking
a pretty simple question,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.600
but one that's really important for
students. Does listening to music help you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.260
focus and read better, or does it just
make things harder?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.280
And I think the answer is pretty clear.
I'm going to be arguing that background

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.960
noise, and yes, that includes music,
almost always steals your focus and makes

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.280
it harder to concentrate. See, I disagree.
My position is that music,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.800
especially if you've had some training,
can actually boost your brain and help

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.440
with learning. Well, let's start there. I
believe music is often helpful,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.000
not hurtful. There's a lot of research
showing that learning to play an

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.580
instrument, you know, music training, can
make a child's brain stronger.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.560
And this often leads to higher scores on
reading tests and just better

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.000
focus skills in general. Okay. Plus, think
about it.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.360
Instrumental music, especially something
like classical music,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.980
can really improve a student's mood. It
can make them feel less anxious,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.000
which, you know, makes it so much easier
to pay attention to hard work.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.320
I see that point, but I think you're
missing the bigger picture.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
When a student is reading, any background
noise, any

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.520
talk, any music, it has a small but very
real

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.040
bad effect on their reading. It's just
harder for the brain to concentrate fully.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.960
A bad effect? Always? I think so, yeah.
It's because the brain's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.900
resources, its brain power is shared. So
if music is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
playing, some of that brain power has to
go to listening to the music instead of

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.580
focusing on the reading. So really,
silence is always the best for getting

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
work done. That really depends on the kind
of music,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.540
doesn't it? I mean, we have to look at
whether there are words or not.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.100
Instrumental music, so music without any
singing, is shown to be way,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.380
way less distracting. Mm-hmm. There was
even one study that found that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
instrumental versions of songs students
already knew still help them focus better

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.020
than songs that had lyrics. Better than
silence in some cases.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.960
Ah, but you just made my point for me. The
biggest problem is music with

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.000
words, with lyrics. When music has
singers, the brain tries to,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960
you know, figure out what they're saying
instead of focusing on the book.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
That is the number one distraction. Okay,
I'll give you that lyrics can be a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.420
problem. It's a huge problem. And not just
that. Music that's too fast or

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.420
too loud also causes a big drop in how
well students understand what they're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.280
reading. Students are just, well, less
likely to do well on a reading assignment

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.060
with that kind of music than they would in
a totally quiet room.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.140
I still believe that the long-term
benefits of music training and the focus

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.540
you can get from the right kind of
instrumental music,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
well, they outweigh that risk of
distraction. The music becomes a sort of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.600
predictable, calming background noise that
actually helps.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.240
And I would conclude that any background
sound can pull focus from the task at

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.060
hand. If we want students to do their best
reading, we should just give them a quiet

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.200
space to do it. It's the safest and most
reliable way to help them concentrate.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
So it seems we both agree that the
specific type of music really makes a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.840
difference. You know, whether it has
words, how loud it is,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.840
or if it's a song you already know. These
things can change everything.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.600
Exactly. And more research is always
needed to find out what works best for

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.460
each individual learner. It's not a
one-size-fits-all answer.
