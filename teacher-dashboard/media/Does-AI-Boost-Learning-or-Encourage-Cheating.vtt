00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.599
Welcome to the debate.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.328
Today, we're looking at the,
uh, huge and rapid push to

3
00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.528
bring generative AI tools
into our schools, all the way

4
00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.459
from K-twelve to university.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.499
And it forces us to ask a
really important question:

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.449
Is AI a net positive,
something that actually

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.159
helps learning?

8
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.467
Or do the risks to things
like fairness and honesty

9
00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:22.779
actually hurt learning
more than they help?

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.728
I'll be arguing that AI is
not just a benefit, it's

11
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.899
becoming a necessity.

12
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.467
And I'll argue that while,
yes, the promise of making

13
00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.079
things easier is appealing,
the risks are just too high.

14
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.529
We're talking about bias,
cheating, and frankly, a

15
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.908
real drop in the kind of
thinking skills we want

16
00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:41.099
students to develop.

17
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.779
We need to be much
more cautious.

18
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.579
Look, AI is already here.

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.799
It's part of the
world we live in.

20
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.628
For teachers, not using it
means missing out on, I mean,

21
00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.579
massive gains in efficiency.

22
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.499
Think about it.

23
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.209
AI can help generate lesson
plans, draft quizzes,

24
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.559
handle emails.

25
00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.999
This frees up-
