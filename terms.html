  <p>
    These Terms of Service apply to all educational tools created under the Made by Maggie
    brand, including but not limited to the Ultimate Argumentative Essay Organizer, Opinion
    Organizer, Conclusion Builder, and any future classroom or instructional tools provided
    through madebymaggie.org.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using these tools, you agree to use them for educational and instructional purposes only.
    Users retain full ownership of any writing, documents, or instructional materials they create
    while using the tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not store or manage user-created documents on external servers. All work is stored only
    in the user’s own Google Drive or browser storage, depending on the tool being used. 
    We do not access any user files other than those actively opened and used with the tool.

    will meet any specific classroom or instructional needs.

  <p>
    These terms may change or be updated as the tools evolve. Continued use of the tools implies
    acceptance of any updated terms.
