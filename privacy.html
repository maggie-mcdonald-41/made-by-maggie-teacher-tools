  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address (via Google Sign-In):</strong> If you choose to sign in with Google, we request access to your email address. This is used to identify your work and support autosave to Google Drive. It is not used for marketing, communication, or shared with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Work:</strong> Your essay data is stored either in your browser’s local storage or in your own Google Drive, depending on which features you use. We do not store your work on any external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To connect your saved work to your account</li>
    <li>To autosave your progress in your own Google Drive if enabled</li>
    <li>To help you resume or recover your writing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Your data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising. This tool is built to support learning — not to track or monetize user behavior.
