  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 8, 2025</p>

  <p>
    MadeByMaggie.org values your privacy. We collect only the information needed to support saving and editing student work for the organizers. This privacy policy applies to all Made by Maggie teaching tools, including the
Argumentative Essay Organizer, Opinion Organizer, Conclusion Builder, and any future tools developed under the Made by Maggie brand.

  </p>

  <h2>What We Collect with the Orgnanizers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address (via Google Sign-In):</strong> If you choose to sign in with Google, we request access to your email address. This is used to identify your work and support autosave to Google Drive. It is not used for marketing, communication, or shared with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Work:</strong> Your essay data is stored either in your browser’s local storage or in your own Google Drive, depending on which features you use. We do not store your work on any external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To connect your saved work to your account</li>
    <li>To autosave your progress in your own Google Drive if enabled</li>
    <li>To help you resume or recover your writing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Protection and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All communication between the app and Google services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
    <li>The app only requests the <code>drive.file</code> and <code>userinfo.email</code> permissions, which limit access to files you create or explicitly select for use with the app.</li>
    <li>Your work is stored only in your own Google Drive account or your browser’s local storage — never on our servers.</li>
    <li>No personal data or file contents are shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not retain or back up your files outside of your Google Drive or local storage; deleting them from those locations permanently removes them from our access.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>For all Made by Maggie Teacher Tools:</h2>
<p>The tool only requests the minimum permissions required to perform its functions. 
Some tools may request permission to edit the currently open Google Doc, display a 
sidebar, save documents you create into your own Google Drive, or identify your Google
account for saving progress. <br> All permissions are limited to the documents and resources you are actively using with 
the tool. The tools do not access, read, search, or modify any other files in your 
Google Drive.
</p>

  <p>
    This tool is built to support learning — not to track or monetize user behavior.
