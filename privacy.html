  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: August 9, 2025</p>

  <p>
    MadeByMaggie.org values your privacy. We collect only the information needed to support saving and editing student work.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address (via Google Sign-In):</strong> If you choose to sign in with Google, we request access to your email address. This is used to identify your work and support autosave to Google Drive. It is not used for marketing, communication, or shared with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Work:</strong> Your essay data is stored either in your browser’s local storage or in your own Google Drive, depending on which features you use. We do not store your work on any external servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To connect your saved work to your account</li>
    <li>To autosave your progress in your own Google Drive if enabled</li>
    <li>To help you resume or recover your writing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Protection and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All communication between the app and Google services is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
    <li>The app only requests the <code>drive.file</code> and <code>userinfo.email</code> permissions, which limit access to files you create or explicitly select for use with the app.</li>
    <li>Your work is stored only in your own Google Drive account or your browser’s local storage — never on our servers.</li>
    <li>No personal data or file contents are shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not retain or back up your files outside of your Google Drive or local storage; deleting them from those locations permanently removes them from our access.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This tool is built to support learning — not to track or monetize user behavior.
